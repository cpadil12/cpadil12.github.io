                    <h2>Incredible pride-themed looks</h2>
                    <h3 class="subheading"> These artists celebrated Pride with unique makeup looks. </h3>
                    <h5>By Kaleigh Fasanella </h5>
                        <p>For anyone unaware, Pride wouldn't exist as we know it if it weren't for the inimitable Marsha P. Johnson — a Black trans woman who was a pioneer in the Stonewall uprising of 1969, and an outspoken advocate for the LGBTQIA+ community and their rights as equals. This means Pride wouldn't be what it is today without Black people. Period. End of story. And so, with the month in full swing, we're taking the opportunity to spotlight just some of our favorite Pride-themed looks from Black beauty creators.</p>

                        <p> As you'll see, these artists — many of whom are self-taught — have gone above and beyond to create bold and ingenious looks that are unlike anything you've seen before. Their skill and imagination should be celebrated not only now during Pride month, but every day of the year. So once you're done scrolling through for inspiration, don't forget to throw them a follow on Instagram where they share their content on a regular basis.</p>
